  "readme": "# xls\n\nCurrently a parser for XLS files.  Cleanroom implementation from the Microsoft Open Specifications.\n\nThis has been tested on some basic XLS files generated from Excel 2011 (using compatibility mode).\n\nIf you need something that is not currently supported, file an issue and attach a sample file.  I will get to it :)\n\n## Installation\n\nIn the browser:\n\n    <script src=\"xls.js\"></script>\n\nIn node:\n\n    require('xlsjs').readFile('file');\n\nThe command-line utility `xls2csv` shows how to generate a CSV from an XLS.\n\n## Usage\n\nSee http://oss.sheetjs.com/js-xls/ for a browser example.\n\nSee `bin/xls2csv` for a node example.\n\n## Notes\n\n`CFB` refers to the Microsoft Compound File Binary Format, a container format for XLS as well as DOC and other pre-OOXML data formats.\n\nThe mechanism is split into a CFB parser (which scans through the file and produces concrete data chunks) and a Workbook parser (which does excel-specific parsing).\n\n`.SheetNames` is an ordered list of the sheets in the workbook\n \n`.Sheets[sheetname]` returns a data structure representing the sheet\n\n`.Sheets[sheetname][address].val` returns the value of the cell.  Types are currently not recorded (but Number and RkNumber show up as javascript Numbers).\n\n## Test Files\n\nTest files are housed in [another repo](https://github.com/SheetJS/test_files).\n\nRunning `make init` will refresh the `test_files` submodule and get the files.\n\nTests utilize the mocha testing framework.  Travis-CI and Sauce Labs links:\n\n - <https://travis-ci.org/SheetJS/js-xls> for XLS module in node\n - <https://travis-ci.org/SheetJS/SheetJS.github.io> for XLS* modules\n - <https://saucelabs.com/u/sheetjs> for XLS* modules using Sauce Labs \n\n## License\n\nPlease consult the attached LICENSE file for details.
